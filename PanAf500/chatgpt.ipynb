       "[{'generated_text': '\\nThis data describes a video:\\nspecies: troglodytes schweinfurthii\\nlocation_metadata: trail\\nhabitat: forest - mixed, open under storey\\nbehaviours: carrying object, carrying young, playing, social interaction, travelling\\n\\nSummary:\\nThe video shows chimpanzees \\xa0moving from one tree to another in a simple manner, but not always with the intention of being \\'carrying\\' or having fun. But if you can see the species in this video without jumping to conclusions: chimpanzees \\xa0move with simple gestures. They like to play with your hand as it moves.\\xa0\\nTrying to get out of the box and be excited to hear a wild animal with a long, curved, white hair moving away is amazing to learn how these animals live...\\nWhat are the basic laws of our understanding of our ape ancestors? The species we studied has been closely associated with our ancestors\\xa0 and their behaviors... The first documented evidence of our origins comes in an article described in 1995 by David M. Smith, \"The Fossil Genomic Evidence for Our Ancestors \"\\nHow did this information get into this new book of ancient apes?\\nIt\\'s really good...\\nI have no idea how long after this article made reference to our\\xa0 initial evolutionary theory (including post evolutionary theory, with the evolutionary work by E.V.L. Kallman, who is now Professor of Natural History at the University of California, Santa Barbara). I don\\'t recall how I knew how long after this article the reference was removed. This is because I think my book has many more interesting questions that didn\\'t really start or finish with the article in the first place. Many of the ideas about apes, their ancestry, the origin of new animals and life, and how they come to be \\'found\\' in apes are not true. In fact, it\\'s not clear at all that this paper by Smith was ever written by any one\\'scientist\\' or even his predecessors. If you think this is all just a hoax, then let me assure you: this \\'official\\' scientific journal is in fact not reputable. Its main article is not a scientific article, it\\'s a political one. This is simply an article that is deliberately misleading and not written by the scientists involved in the papers, not by their editor. They are in fact a large body of work from very knowledgeable scientists.\\nLet\\'s take a look at how those papers got published and what made them so popular. The above chart shows which of the papers got written more highly in Science. These papers are published in Nature, which is a scientific journal, but it tends to follow some other science where things are just published under this heading. These papers give readers something to digest. We often think of the big names as having been published by prestigious institutions and journals such as the British Academy of Science, American Physical Society and the New York Academy of Sciences.\\nWhile Science usually publishes papers in one of these journals, we can check things out on other continents. I\\'m not talking about the USA, or Canada, or Australia, or a number of other places on this list that don\\'t publish articles by reputable scientists. We have been exposed to so much stuff that is published on the internet that it\\'s hard to understand the reason why certain papers in them get to be a lot more popular than others. The idea of the paper being \\'popular\\' can be described as the same as something like the idea that a certain new insect is brought to life and the same as the idea that some plant will become strong enough to cause other plants to become strong enough to get to the top. If it is possible then it makes perfect sense for the scientific community to be involved in publishing any papers that it considers to be popular. To help our species to become more active, all of the scientific papers you see here are by actual scientists who have been exposed to the kinds of discoveries that are found in other groups.\\nSo the author, David A. Smith, has published a book called What Happened to the Chimp?, called The Great Scientific Revolution. This book is a series of articles showing how a number of things were changed in the process of evolution. This book shows how the origins of many different species have changed based on genetic information, such as the numbers of cells and proteins in each individual. The basic ideas for evolution are that there are many different\\'species\\'. But the most important change was in the number of people who attended these conferences and even more important was when the idea of this\\'species changing\\' began to change over time. There are still many people out there who cannot understand why this idea has changed so quickly. This is especially true when you compare the total number of people who attended the conferences to the number of people who are still not sure. Another important point is that in many cases, most of the conference papers are of the same quality'}]"
